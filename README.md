# Password Generator

## Description

In this repo, I created my own password generator based on what the criteria given by the user. The interface was provided by the uPenn Bootcamp instructor. I learned more about randomizing and the different functions I can use in JavaScript.

Check out the generator here: https://xtourmaline.github.io/password-generator
